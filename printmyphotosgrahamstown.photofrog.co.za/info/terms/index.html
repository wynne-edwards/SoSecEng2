and provide a revised shipping schedule.</p>


<h3>Delivery Policy</h3>

<p>When you click to make a purchase with us legal obligations arise and your right to refund of monies 
charged to your credit card or paid in any other way agreed by us, are limited by our terms & conditions. 
You must not make any purchase through this site unless you understand and agree all our terms and 
conditions. Once payment is made for the purchase, it is deemed that you have read and understood the 
terms and conditions for such purchase. If you have any queries please contact us before making any 
purchase for any service through this website.</p>


<h5>Shipping</h5>

<p>Please ensure the correct shipping address is provided from the outset as title and risk will pass 
to you once the order has left our premises.</p>


<h5>Undeliverable packages</h5>

<p>Occasionally packages are returned to us undeliverable. Should this event take place every attempt 
will be made to contact you to make arrangements for re-shipment.</p>


<h5>Order processing</h5>

<p>Order processing will not begin until we receive a confirmed order and full payment.</p>

<h3>Payment Options and Pricing</h3>

<p>All transactions will be processed in South African Rands (ZAR).</p>

<p>Think Open Software endeavours to offer you competitive prices on current products; you're total 
order price will include the price of the purchase plus any applicable sales tax and shipping charges 
(on the day of shipping).</p>

<p>Think Open Software reserves the right to change pricing at any time without prior notice.</p>

<p>Should Think Open Software reduce its price on any shipped products within 10 working days of shipment, 
you may contact us and request a refund of the difference between the price you were charged and the 
reduced selling price. To receive the refund you must contact us within 14 days of shipment.</p>

other payment options, or simply log off and return to the site at a later time to complete your order.</p>

shopping cart, proceed to "Checkout" and follow the order processing instructions. Select the option to 
pay via EFT. You will then have to load Think Open Software as a beneficiary on your internet banking 
and use the unique order number in the reference line for your payment. This should ensure speedy processing 
and delivery of your selected products.</p>
